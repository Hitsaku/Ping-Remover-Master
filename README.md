# Ping-Remover

A new SP with a new algorithm to stop any form of ghosting/desync and achieve true 0 ping.

Makes skills client-side basically removing any sort of ping tax on your skills.

Block Classes such as: Berserker, Lancer, Brawler come built-in with Block-Cancel when using skills (can be disabled on settings.js on config)

[Information]

Supports all classes, races. 

All lengths, distances are automatically changed depending on the race you play. e.g (Aman, Humam M/F, Cast M,F , etc.)

Supports hard CC so you won't be desyncing/ghosting. You'll be able to block attacks from mobs or players the way a low pinged player would.

[Known Issues]

No issues.
