# Ping-Remover
A new SP with a new algorithm to stop any form of ghosting/desync and achieve true 0 ping.

Makes skills client-side. 

Block Classes such as: Berserker, Lancer, Brawler come built-in with Block-Cancel (can be disabled on setting.js on config)

[Information]
Supports all classes, races. 
All lengths, distances are automatically changed depending on the race you play. e.g (Aman, Humam M/F, Cast M,F , etc.)
Supports hard CC so you will not be desyncing or rubber banding on PvE/PvP.

[Known Issues]
None at this point.
